Revision history for Perl extension Net::Patricia.

1.009 Mon Oct 23 12:45 2000
        - changed add_string and remove_string methods so that they croak if
	  ascii2prefix doesn't grok the key string value.
	  Previously, bad key values would cause perl to abort with this error:

	     perl: patricia.c:645: patricia_lookup: Assertion `prefix' failed.

	  which was reported by Freddy Frouin <freddy.frouin@fluxus.net>

1.008 Wed Oct 18 13:46 2000
	- change XS code to just store a pointer to user data in the
	  Patricia Trie node, rather than a pointer to a perl reference
	  to that user data as was done previously.
        - improved POD

1.007 Wed Oct 18 11:32 2000
	- renamed from Net::PatriciaTrie to Net::Patricia
