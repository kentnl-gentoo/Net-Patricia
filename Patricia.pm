=head1 NAME

Net::Patricia - Patricia Trie perl module for fast IP address lookups

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Patricia;

  my $pt = new Net::Patricia;

  $pt->add_string('127.0.0.0/8', \$user_data);
  $pt->match_string('127.0.0.1');
  $pt->match_exact_string('127.0.0.0');
  $pt->match_integer(2130706433); # 127.0.0.1
  $pt->match_exact_integer(2130706432, 8); # 127.0.0.0
  $pt->remove_string('127.0.0.0/8');
  $pt->climb(sub { print "climbing at node $_[0]\n" });

  undef $pt; # automatically destroys the Patricia Trie

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly
perform IP address prefix matching for applications such as IP subnet,
network or routing table lookups.  The data structure is based on a
radix tree using a radix of two, so sometimes you see patricia
implementations called "radix" as well.  The term "Trie" is derived
from the word "retrieval" but is pronounced like "try".  Patricia
stands for "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded as
Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table lookups by Van
Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance characteristics are well-known as
it has been employed for routing table lookups within the BSD kernel
since the 4.3 Reno release.

The BSD radix code is thoroughly described in "TCP/IP Illustrated,
Volume 2" by Wright and Stevens and in the paper ``A Tree-Based Packet
Routing Table for Berkeley Unix'' by Keith Sklower.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new> - create a new Net::Patricia object

   $pt = new Net::Patricia;

This is the class' constructor - it returns a C<Net::Patricia> object
upon success or undef on failure.  For now, the constructor takes no
arguments, and defaults to creating a tree which uses AF_INET IPv4
address and mask values as keys.  In the future it will probably take
one argument such as AF_INET or AF_INET6 to specify whether or not you
are use 32-bit IP addresses as keys or 128-bit IPv6 addresses.

The C<Net::Patricia> object will be destroyed automatically when
there are no longer any references to it.

=item B<add_string>

  $pt->add_string(key_string[,user_data]);

The first argument, key_string, is a network or subnet specification in
canonical form, e.g. "10.0.0.0/8", where the number after the slash
represents the number of bits in the netmask.  If no mask width is
specified, the longest possible mask is assumed, i.e. 32 bits for
AF_INET addresses.

The second argument, user_data, is optional.  If supplied, it should be
a SCALAR value (which may be a perl reference) specifying the user data
that will be stored in the Patricia Trie node.  Subsequently, this
value will be returned by the match methods described below to indicate
a successful search.  Remember that perl references and objects are
represented as SCALAR values and therefore the user data can be
complicated data objects.

If no second argument is passed, the key_string will be stored as the
user data and therfore will likewise be returned by the match
functions.

On success, this method returns the user_data passed as the second
argument or key_string if no user data was specified.  It returns undef
on failure.

=item B<match_string>

  $pt->match_string(key_string);

This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node,
according to normal subnetting rules for the address and mask
specified.

The key_string argument is a network or subnet specification in
canonical form, e.g. "10.0.0.0/8", where the number after the slash
represents the number of bits in the netmask.  If no mask width value
is specified, the longest mask is assumed, i.e. 32 bits for AF_INET
addresses.

If a matching node is found in the Patricia Trie, this method returns
the user data for the node.  This method returns undef on failure.

=item B<match_exact_string>

  $pt->match_exact_string(key_string);

This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node.  Its
semantics are exactly the same as those described for C<match_string>
except that the key must match a node exactly.  I.e. it is not
sufficient that the address and mask specified merely falls within the
subnet specified by a particular node.

=item B<match_integer>

  $pt->match_integer(integer[,mask_bits]);

This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node,
according to normal subnetting rules for the address and mask
specified.  Its semantics are similar to those described for
C<match_string> except that the key is specified using an integer
(i.e.  SCALAR), such as that returned by perl's C<unpack> function for
values converted using the "N" (network-ordered long).  Note that this
argument is not a packed network-ordered long.

Just to be completely clear, the integer argument should be a value of
the sort produced by this code:

   use Socket;
   $integer = unpack("N", inet_aton("10.0.0.0"));

=item B<match_exact_integer>

  $pt->match_exact_integer(integer[,mask_bits]);

This method searches the Patricia Trie to find a matching node.  Its
semantics are exactly the same as C<match_integer> except that the key
must match a node exactly.  I.e. it is not sufficient that the address
and mask specified merely falls within the subnet specified by a
particular node.

=item B<remove_string>

  $pt->remove_string(key_string);

This method removes the node which exactly matches the the address and
mask specified from the Patricia Trie.

If the matching node is found in the Patricia Trie, it is removed, and
this method returns the user data for the node.  This method returns
undef on failure.

=item B<climb>

   $pt->climb([CODEREF]);

This method climbs the Patricia Trie, visiting each node as it does
so.  It performs a non-recursive, "preorder" traversal.

The CODEREF argument is optional.  It is a perl code reference used to
specify a user-defined subroutine to be called when visiting each
node.  The node's user data will be passed as the sole argument to that
subroutine.

This method returns the number of nodes successfully visited while
climbing the Trie.  That is, without a CODEREF argument, it simply
counts the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie.

Note that currently the return value from your CODEREF subroutine is
ignored.  In the future the climb method may return the number of times
your subroutine returned non-zero, as it is called once per node.  So,
if you are currently relying on the climb return value to accurately
report a count of the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie, it would be
prudent to have your subroutine return a non-zero value.

This method is called climb() rather than walk() because climbing trees
(and therfore tries) is a more popular pass-time than walking them.

=item B<climb_inorder>

   $pt->climb_inorder([CODEREF]);

This method climbs the Patricia Trie, visiting each node in order as it
does so.  That is, it performs an "inorder" traversal.

The CODEREF argument is optional.  It is a perl code reference used to
specify a user-defined subroutine to be called when visiting each
node.  The node's user data will be passed as the sole argument to that
subroutine.

This method returns the number of nodes successfully visited while
climbing the Trie.  That is, without a CODEREF argument, it simply
counts the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie.

Note that currently the return value from your CODEREF subroutine is
ignored.  In the future the climb method may return the number of times
your subroutine returned non-zero, as it is called once per node.  So,
if you are currently relying on the climb return value to accurately
report a count of the number of nodes in the Patricia Trie, it would be
prudent to have your subroutine return a non-zero value.

This method is called climb() rather than walk() because climbing trees
(and therfore tries) is a more popular pass-time than walking them.

=back

=head1 BUGS

This modules does not yet support AF_INET6 (IP version 6) 128 bit
addresses, although the underlying patricialib C code does.

When passing a CODEREF argument to the climb method, the return value
from your CODEREF subroutine is currently ignored.  In the future the
climb method may return the number of times your subroutine returned
non-zero, as it is called once per node.  So, if you are currently
relying on the climb return value to accurately report a count of the
number of nodes in the Patricia Trie, it would be prudent to have your
subroutine return a non-zero value.

patricialib, the C library used by this perl extension, is an extracted
version of MRT's patricia code from radix.[ch], which was worked on by
Masaki Hirabaru and Craig Labovitz.  For more info on MRT see:

   http://www.mrtd.net/

The MRT patricia code owes some heritage to GateD's radix code, which
in turn owes something to the BSD kernel.
